# DYNAMIC SELF-LEARNING TRACKER - 300 NEW FEATURES (2601-2900)

## 🧠 PRIYA'S AUTONOMOUS INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM

### Revolutionary Concept
Priya maintains her **OWN** tracker system that **SHE** controls:
- ✅ She decides what to track
- ✅ She creates categories
- ✅ She adds/removes people
- ✅ She assigns scores
- ✅ She learns from patterns
- ✅ She forms insights
- ✅ She makes predictions
- ✅ She runs experiments

**This is NOT pre-programmed. She builds it herself!**
